## Usage

### Execute a Command

Use `exec(command, args...)` to execute a command.

```js
const exec = require('@actions-kit/exec');

await exec.exec("node", "--version");
```

It will returns a `Result` object, which contains an exit code of the execution.
```js
const res = await exec.exec("node", "--version");
if (!res.isOk()) {
  console.log(`Failed with exit code: ${res.code}`);

```

With `execOut(command, args...)`, you can get log output of the execution.
```js
const res = await exec.execOut("node", "--version");
console.log(`Output: ${res.output}`);
```
