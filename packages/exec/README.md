const res = await exec.run("node", "--version");
if (!res.isOk()) {
  console.log(`Failed with exit code: ${res.code}`);
}
```

### Run a Command and Get the Output

Use `output(command, args...)`, to run a command and get the output.
```js
const exec = require('@actions-kit/exec');

const res = await exec.output("node", "--version");
console.log(`Node version: ${res.output}`);
```

### Construct a Command Helper

Construct a command helper to simplify the command run.
```js
const exec = require('@actions-kit/exec');

const node = new exec.Command("node", "-e");
await node.run("process.exit();");
```
